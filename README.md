The goal of `BandingData` is to automate quality control and archiving of bird banding data collected by Rushing Lab members under Federal Bird Banding and Marking Permit #24181 

### Use of data

`BandingData` is a public repo and therefore these data can be freely accessed by anyone as long as the original source of the data is properly cited ([https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3360924](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3360924)). However, these data are primarily meant for use by members of the Rushing Lab at Utah State University. If you wish to use these data for your own purposes, please contact Clark Rushing (clark.rushing[at]usu.edu) to discuss terms and conditions of data usage.
